<lineText>Throw in just a pinch. Oh no, not that much... Oh dear, this was supposed to be green. Try adding some mugwort? No no, diced not shredded. Well we tried, right? I think you have the hang of it.\n\nMy philosophy is to always experiment and try new things. What's the worse that could happen?</lineText>

<lineText>You can practice on any cauldron, and you will find alchemists throughout Dal Riata eager to share their knowledge. They are always looking for victims, err, students to test their new cocktails. The cauldron also plays a role, its surrounding area affects which recipes can be made from it. Just find a cauldron, approach it, and start experimenting!\n\nMany alchemy reagents drop from the flora and fauna, or use containers forged in great furnaces. Good luck, [class], and may Cerridwen grant you wisdom.</lineText>
