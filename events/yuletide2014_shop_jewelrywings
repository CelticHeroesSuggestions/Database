# Yuletide 2014 Jewelry and Wings

* What: Spawn points for the Yuletide 2014 event shops.
* Why: These shops were very popular and would be a nice revival for the game.
* Table: `ch_live_unitydatadb.spawn_points`, `ch_live_unitydatadb.shop`, `ch_live_unitydatadb.shop_stock`.
* Notes: I placed the NPCs on the Farcrag Castle parapets to give more content there.
* Changes:
```
# Ansgar of Glenmor (jewelry trader)
INSERT INTO ch_live_unitydatadb.spawn_points (spawn_point_id, zone_id, respawn_time, position_x, position_y, position_z, patrol, monster_list, patrol_speed, init_y_angle, max_respawn_time, min_despawn_time, max_despawn_time, despawn)
VALUES (14502, 93, 50, 28.52, 40, -83.64, "stand", "876,1", 1, 40, 12, 0, 0, 0);

# Dolina of Glenmor (wing mount trader)
