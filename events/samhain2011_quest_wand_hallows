# Halloween 2011: Wand of Hallows Question

* What: Spawn points for the Halloween 2011 Wand of Hallows quest.
* Why: This quest was very popular and would be a nice revival for the game.
* Table: `ch_live_unitydatadb.spawn_points`, `ch_live_unitydatadb.item_spawns`.
* Notes: I placed the NPCs near Stonevale Farm to give more content there.
* Changes:
```
# This quest uses the Festus the Mad NPC, which is spawned in the Samhain 2012 event. See `samhain2012_quest_wand_bats.md`. The NPC is located in the Tavern.

# Patch in the `events/conversation/cv_festus_mad.md` file

# Move the quest to Tavern
UPDATE ch_live_unitydatadb.quest_templates SET zone = 9 WHERE quest_id = 96;

# Spawn Lord Pumpleroot and the Lesser Pumpleroot
INSERT INTO ch_live_unitydatadb.spawn_points (spawn_point_id, zone_id, respawn_time, position_x, position_y, position_z, patrol, monster_list, patrol_speed, init_y_angle, max_respawn_time, min_despawn_time, max_despawn_time, despawn)
VALUES (11401, 2, 15, -39.78, 0, -10.39, "random 5 0 0 3", "70645,1;70651,3;", 1, 45, 30, 0, 0, 0);
```
