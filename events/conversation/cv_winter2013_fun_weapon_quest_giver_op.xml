<!--<lineText>The terrible Gloomgaze is going to take over Yuletide - he's possessed all the Yulefather's helpers, and they're going to do something really nasty! I need your help!</lineText>-->
<lineText>Every Yule, adversaries across the land lay down their weapons to become 'Yule Helpers', assisting the Yulefather in giving out presents in the spirit of friendship... but now tragedy has struck! The Yulefather's arch-enemy, the evil spirit Gloomgaze, has cast a spell over all the Yule Helpers, taking them under his control. Now he's going to use them to ruin the Yule celebrations for everybody - [class], we need your help!</lineText>

<!--<lineText>I need you to gather snowballs by bashing the snowmen you can find around Lir's Reach, then throw one at each of the Helpers that have been possessed by Gloomgaze in order to knock them out. When all the helpers have been knocked out, come back to me. Will you aid me?</lineText>-->
<lineText>The only way to break the spell over the Yule Helpers is to knock them out - a solidly packed snowball should do the trick! Loot snowballs from the Snowmen you'll find across Lir's Reach - then use one snowball on each of the Yule Helpers. If you are successful in this task, I'll reward you with a speical Candycane weapon. Will you aid me, [name]?</lineText>

<!--<lineText>Well done, [name], but we're not safe yet. Gloomgaze still remains, and must be defeated. I need you to find Gloomgaze, defeat him, and recover the Gloom Crystal that he's using to control the Yulefather's Helpers. Will you get the crystal for me?</lineText>-->
<lineText>You have done well, [name]. The Yule Helpers' minds are their own once more... but Gloomgaze himself still remains. I ask one final task of you - find Gloomgaze and retreive his Crystal of Command. Without it he will be unable to take back control of the Yulefather's Helpers, and Yule will belong to the forces of joy and merriment once again - will you get the crystal, [name]?</lineText>

<lineText>Thank you, [name]. You've foiled Gloomgaze's schemes and helped bring some Yule cheer to Lir's Reach - please accept this weapon as a reward, crafted by the Yulefather himself! Gloomgaze never stays defeated for long, however, and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before he's back to his old tricks. If you ever fancy earning another one of these weapons, come back and see me - I'm sure I'll have need of your help.</lineText>

<lineText>I need you to recover Gloomgaze's Crystal of Command to prevent him taking back control of the Yule Helpers. You can loot the Crystal of Command from Gloomgaze, but he is a formidable opponent, so you may need to group together with some fellow adventurers to defeat him.</lineText>

<lineText>Where the Yulefather brings cheer to the Celtic lands during the harsh winter months, his arch-enemy Gloomgaze has only malice and contempt in his cold heart, and seeks to stop the Yulefather at every turn. If Gloomgaze got his way, the only presents we would get for Yule would be hail and sleet! I'm proud to be one of the Yulefather's Helpers this year, but there's not much the likes of me can do against Gloomgaze - fortunately, you're on my side!</lineText>
