<lineText>So this is what a [class] looks like these days is it? Maybe you have potential, but I've seen too many like you fall before their time. I have some work for an adventurer, true, but until you have gained more experience I cannot entrust you with the duties I have. Return to me when you are level 40 and we will talk again.</lineText>

<lineText>Hail, [race]. Once again our clan is in dire need of a capable [class]. The ice dragon Natan Athach has arrived in Lir's Reach, and his presence has awakened great beasts that have slumbered in the hidden places of our land. Now they have awoken, they must be beaten back lest Lir's Reach is overrun. I cannot offer much as a reward, but this quest will give you valuable experience.</lineText>

<lineText>That is joyous news, [race]. In defeating these creatures, you've brought peace to our lands, at least for a while. Alas, I fear that more of their ilk will arrive 'ere long. Please accept this potion as a token of my gratitude. It is but a small gesture - the experience you have gained on your adventure is the real reward. Come back and see me tomorrow - I may have more work for you then. Farewell, [name].</lineText>
