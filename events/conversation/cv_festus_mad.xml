<lineText>It's natural for a mage of my level of intellect and brilliance to be doubted - but to be laughed at is an insult I cannot stand! They called me batty, [class] - insane! I'll show them batty, I'll make a weapon that fires bats that bite people with their tiny teeth! Oh! Did someone say "pumpkin"?</lineText>

<lineText>When I said I wanted to make a wand that fired pumpkins instead of fireballs, they laughed at me - they laughed! Haaahahahaha!

<lineText>Ah, my apprentice comes gambolling towards me once again, I see. Keen to hear some more words of wisdom from the mind of a genius, are we?

Nothing to do with that at all, you hear, [name]? I'm not crazy enough to give away my secrets, you know!</lineText>


<!-- <lineText pageNext="Next.">Nevertheless, I need some ingredients to aid in the construction of this weapon.
