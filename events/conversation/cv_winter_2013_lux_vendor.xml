<lineText>Welcome, [class]. My name is Braith - I spent most of the year exploring lands to the north, searching for valuable artifacts to sell upon my return. I have a fine selection of treasures that would be a good fit for a [class] like you. Alas, I fear you do not have the means to make a purchase just yet. Please come back when you have at least 10,000 gold.</lineText>

<lineText>Welcome, [class]. My name is Braith, and although Dal Riata is my home, I spend the summer months journeying through the northern lands. When the snows begin to come in earnest, I know it is time to head south once more. I sell the valuable items I have discovered on my travels, and this pays for next year's expedition. Would you like to see what I have to sell?</lineText>
