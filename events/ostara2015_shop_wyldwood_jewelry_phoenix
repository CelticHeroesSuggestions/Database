# Ostara 2015 Jewelry and Phoenixes

* What: Spawn points for the Ostara 2015 event shops.
* Why: These shops were very popular and would be a nice revival for the game.
* Table: `ch_live_unitydatadb.spawn_points`, `ch_live_unitydatadb.shop`, `ch_live_unitydatadb.shop_stock`.
* Notes: I placed the NPCs near Stonevale Farm to give more content there.
* Changes:
```
# Gayle the Hunter (jewelry trader)
