# Database

Contains ready-to-run suggestions for the database! We make no guarantee that these suggestions are possible or will run, but they are a starting point for DECA to make changes.

Spawn ID Convention:
- YYEXXX
- YY: Year of the Event or Mob (2012 -> 12, 2015 -> 15)
- E: Event (Ostara=1, Anniversary=2, Beltane=3, Samhain=4, Yuletide=5)
- XXX: Item/Spawn/Mob/whatever number (incremental) 

If you contribute a suggestion with a SQL command, please take care not to overlap on other suggestions, in case DECA chooses to copy/paste the suggestions as is.
