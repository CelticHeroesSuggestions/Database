# Druid Balancing: Skill and Gear Changes

* What: Update druid skills and gear to fix minor issues
* Why: Druids have some questionable gear and skills, that would be easy for DECA to update for immediate improvements.
* Notes: This does not include a comprehensive staff redo, which is sorely needed. My idea for staffs is to make them superior to druid totem/offhands for casters (so totem have a place for melee-assisted DPS), giving regen/stats/skill points.
* Changes:
```

Update Strangling Vine's skill effect in `status_effects_list.txt`
