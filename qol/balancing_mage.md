# Mage Balancing: Skill and Gear Changes

* What: Update mage gear and skills to be better balanced between Ice and Fire.
* Why: Fire skills and gear have a higher DPS than ice skills and gear, which is unfair for ice builds.
* Notes: The vibes for the elements are: Fire (quick, low damage) and Ice (slow, high damage, longer range)
* Changes:
```
# Ice vs. Fire

# increase Ice Shards cast range
UPDATE ch_live_unitydatadb.skill_templates SET casting_range = 12 WHERE skill_id = 42;
# increase Ice Blast cast range
UPDATE ch_live_unitydatadb.skill_templates SET casting_range = 12 WHERE skill_id = 221;
# increase Frostbite cast range
UPDATE ch_live_unitydatadb.skill_templates SET casting_range = 12 WHERE skill_id = 222;

# increase Ice Shards damage for non-PvP
# at level 50 with 500foc and 8000ability, IS does 6474/(15+1)=405 and FB does 4462/(6.5)=686), so FB has a 70% gain
# therefore, increase Ice Shards damage by 1.8x to make the DPS comparable. NOT INCLUDING PVP!
UPDATE ch_live_unitydatadb.skill_template_levels SET initial_damage = initial_damage * 1.8, base_amount = base_amount * 1.8 WHERE skill_template_id = 42 and pvp = 0;
# to select in the format for skill_list.txt: SELECT skill_level, initial_damage, casting_time, recharge_time, energy_cost, chance_of_success, charging_protection, min_level, pvp FROM ch_live_unitydatadb.skill_template_levels WHERE skill_template_id = 42;

# evaluate Ice Blast damage, chose not to increase it
# at level 50 with 500foc and 8000ability, IB does 7174/(20+3)=312 and FS does 5498/(15+2)=323), so FS has a 3% gain - we can leave it alone

# increase Frostbite damage for non-PvP, as well as the duration (30s -> 60s)
# at level 50 with 500foc and 8000ability, Frost does 2482(1223)/tick and Incin does 2227/tick, so Incin has a 80% gain (the initial damage is negligible)
UPDATE ch_live_unitydatadb.status_effect_levels SET effect_amount = effect_amount * 1.8, base_amount = base_amount * 1.8, duration = 60 WHERE status_effect_template_id = 139 and pvp = 0;
# to select in the format for status_effects_list.txt: SELECT skill_level, initial_damage, casting_time, recharge_time, energy_cost, chance_of_success, charging_protection, min_level, pvp FROM ch_live_unitydatadb.skill_template_levels WHERE skill_template_id = 42;

# make the BT helms equal focus and vit (currently Mysticism [fire] has higher focus)
UPDATE ch_live_unitydatadb.item_templates SET stat_bonus = '2^200;3^200' WHERE item_id = 63575;
UPDATE ch_live_unitydatadb.item_templates SET stat_bonus = '2^250;3^250' WHERE item_id = 63576;
UPDATE ch_live_unitydatadb.item_templates SET stat_bonus = '2^300;3^300' WHERE item_id = 63577;
UPDATE ch_live_unitydatadb.item_templates SET stat_bonus = '2^400;3^400' WHERE item_id = 63578;
UPDATE ch_live_unitydatadb.item_templates SET stat_bonus = '2^500;3^500' WHERE item_id = 63579;
# will also need to update this on the clientside text.db

# evaluate the Ice Blast bonus from BT charms ID 64448-64452, should be equal DPS to FS (ID 63258-63262)
# bonus (DPS): 400 (23) vs 800 (35), 500 (29) vs 1000 (43), 600 (35) vs 1200 (52), 800 (47) vs 1600 (70), 1000 (59) vs 2000 (87)
# given the stat bonus are equal on both charms, the DPS gap closes a bit - we can keep BT charms as-is
